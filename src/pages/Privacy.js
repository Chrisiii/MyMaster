            Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. While scientists
            continue to hunt for clues of life beyond Earth, our home planet
            remains the only place in the universe where we've ever identified
            living organisms. Earth is the fifth-largest planet in the solar
            system. It's smaller than the four gas giants — Jupiter, Saturn,
            Uranus and Neptune — but larger than the three other rocky planets,
            Mercury, Mars and Venus. Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles
            (13,000 kilometers) and is mostly round because gravity generally
            pulls matter into a ball. But the spin of our home planet causes it
            to be squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator, making the
            true shape of the Earth an "oblate spheroid."
